# Presentation
**penguins-eggs** is a console tool, under continuous development, that allows you to remaster your system and redistribute it as live images on usb sticks or via PXE.

The default behavior is total removal of the system's data and users, but it is also possible to remaster the system including the data and accounts of present users, using flag **--clone**. It is also possible to keep the users and files present under an encrypted LUKS file within the same resulting iso file, flag **--cryptedclone**.

You can easily install the resulting live system with the calamares installer or the internal TUI krill installer. 

It is possible to have also unattended installation using **--unattended** flag.

Thanks to the wardrobe, you can create or use scripts to switch from a **naked** version - with only a CLI interface - and `wear` it with a full GUI or server configurations. 

See [penguins-wardrobe](https://github.com/pieroproietti/penguins-wardrobe), fork it and adapt to yours needs.

# Technology

eggs is written mostly in typescript and ideally can be used with different Linux distributions. Yes, there are big differences in terms of package manager used, path, etc, but basically the various programs used to build the live are the same. 

Currently eggs supports: [Debian](https://www.debian.org/), [Devuan](https://www.devuan.org/), [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/), [Arch](https://archlinux.org/), [Manjaro](https://manjaro.org/) and [derivatives](./conf/derivatives.yaml); regarding architectures eggs currently support amd64, i386 and arm64. 

Since version `9.6.x` Penguins' eggs is released - as Debian package - for: `amd64`, `i386` and `arm64` architectures, supporting the majority of PCs, old ones and single board ARM systems like Raspberry Pi. Read more on the article [Triple somersault!](https://penguins-eggs.net/blog/triple-somersault).

You can get more informations on the [blog](https://penguins-eggs.net/blog/distros-that-can-be-remastered-with-eggs), some examples of iso images remastered with eggs are in the [sourceforge page of the project](https://sourceforge.net/projects/penguins-eggs/files/ISOS/).


# Features

## wardrobe, themes and addons

wardrobe was added to eggs on april 2022. It is a way to guide and consolidate the process of creating a custom version of Linux, starting from a CLI system. All my personal editions are passed to use wardrobe for their convenience, in that way I can organize, consolidate and manage better my work. I used birds names for my customizations, except for naked, we have: colibri, eagle, duck,  owl and chicks under [bookworm](https://sourceforge.net/projects/penguins-eggs/files/ISOS/debian/bookworm/)  and [plastilinux](https://sourceforge.net/projects/penguins-eggs/files/ISOS/plastilinux/), wagtail, warbier under [waydroid](https://sourceforge.net/projects/penguins-eggs/files/ISOS/waydroid/) on eggs' sourceforge page.

I hope peoples will be interested in wardrobe and you will end to fork the main repository and add your customizations: together will be possibile to make great steps impossible for a single developer. You can read more in wardrobe on [Penguins' eggs blog](https://penguins-eggs.net/blog/wardrobe-colibri-duck-eagle-and-owl/).

Addons, mostly themes have been grouped under `vendors` folder in the penguins-wardrobe, try to use wardrobe for all your customizations. 

Consult [wardrobe users' guide](https://penguins-eggs.net/docs/Tutorial/wardrobe-users-guide).

## clone/cryptedclone
You can create your live to distribute it - the default mode - or with datas using clone and clonecrypted:

```eggs produce``` 

Completely removes user data from live, this is the preset mode

```eggs produce --clone``` 

Saves our users and our data directly in the generated iso. The data will be visible directly from the live and accessible to anyone who gets a copy.

```eggs produce --cryptedclone``` 

Saves our data within the generated iso using a LUKS volume. Our data will NOT be visible in the live system but can be reinstalled automatically with krill installer. Even having the generated image available, our data will be protected by the LUKS passphrase.

* ```eggs produce``` this is the default: all private data are removed on the live.
* ```eggs produce --clone``` include all users data UNCRYPTED directly on the live.
* ```eggs produce --cryptedclone``` include all users data CRYPTED on a LUKS volume inside the iso.

Using krill: ```sudo eggs install``` will automaticaly restore your CRYPTED data during the installation.

## calamares and krill
eggs was developed to use [calamares](https://calamares.io) as the system installer and allows its customization with themes. It also includes its own installer, called krill, which allows you to produce and install CLI systems such as servers. krill uses a CLI interface that mimics calamares and uses the same configuration files created by eggs for calamares. This provides a "roughly similar" installation experience for both desktop and server installations. With krill it is also possible to have unattended installations, simply by adding the ``--unattended`` flag, the configuration values can be changed in ``/etc/penguins-eggs.d/krill.yaml`` and will then be used for automatic installation.

## cuckoo
The cuckoo lays its eggs in the nests of other birds, and the eggs are hatched by the latter. Similarly eggs can start a self-configuring PXE service to allow you to boot and install your iso on third party networked computers. Command cuckoo can be used either to deploy a newly created iso on an installed system or by live booting the iso itself. 

## mom and dad
I added two built-in assistants with eggs: mom and dad. While mom is a script based on [easybashgui](https://github.com/BashGui/easybashgui) that explains the various commands and documentation, dad started as a shortcut to properly configure eggs: just type ```sudo eggs dad``` and follow simple instructions. Even faster, using ```sudo eggs dad -d``` you will resets the configuration, loads defaults, deletes created isos. At this point, with eggs configured, just type ```sudo produce``` to generate your live.

## yolk 
yolk - so called staying on the subject of eggs - is a local repository included in the livecd that contains a minimum of indispensable packages during installation. Thanks to yolk, you can safely install your system without the need of an active internet connection.

# Packages
Supporting various distributions, we need to have different packages. Debian, Devuan and Ubuntu share the .deb packages for amd_64 and i386 architecture, while Arch and ManjaroLinux use their own PKGBUILDs.

## Debian families
eggs is released as a deb package for amd64, i386 and arm64 too.

Because of eggs' features, the packages can be installed in Debian, Devuan, or Ubuntu-based distros without worrying about exact version (buster, bullseye, bookworm, trixie, chimaera, daedalus, bionic, focal and jammy) are reported to work, of course respect the processor architecture. 

The packages includes standard scripts for preinst, postinst, prerm and postrm and man pages. 

### Install eggs
There are more than a way to install eggs as .deb package, the most practical is to add and use penguins-eggs-ppa.

#### Download the package and install with dpkg

The simplest way to install eggs is download the [package eggs](https://sourceforge.net/projects/penguins-eggs/files/DEBS/) from [sourceforge page of the project](https://sourceforge.net/projects/penguins-eggs/) and install it

```
sudo dpkg -i eggs_9.6.18_amd64.deb 
```

or, on a i386 system:
```
sudo dpkg -i eggs_9.6.18_i386.deb
```

Once eggs is installed you can add the [penguins-eggs-ppa](https://pieroproietti.github.io/penguins-eggs-ppa) repository with the command: ```sudo eggs tools ppa --install```

#### Using penguins-eggs-ppa (stable version)

You can use a little utility I wrote: `addaura`. Use it in this way:

* `git clone https://github.com/pieroproietti/addaura`
* `cd addaura`
* `sudo ./addaura`

On Debian, Devuan and Ubuntu addaura will add the ppa and install eggs.

For derivatives of Debian, Devuan and Ubuntu, like Linuxmint, LMDE, etc, addaura will refuce to work but You can again copy and paste the following two lines in a terminal:

```
curl -fsSL https://pieroproietti.github.io/penguins-eggs-ppa/KEY.gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/penguins-eggs.gpg
echo "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture)] https://pieroproietti.github.io/penguins-eggs-ppa ./" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/penguins-eggs.list > /dev/null
```

Update your repositories and install eggs:

```
sudo apt update && sudo apt install eggs
```

### Upgrade eggs
If you are using penguins-eggs-ppa You can upgrade eggs as others packages just: **sudo apt upgrade**, else simply download new versions of eggs from [sourgeforge page](https://sourceforge.net/projects/penguins-eggs/files/DEBS/) and install it with the standard command **sudo dpkg -i eggs_9.6.18_amd64.deb** or **gdebi eggs_9.6.18_i386.deb**.

## Arch families
eggs has been present in [AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/) for a long time, even without my knowledge thanks the support of Arch peoples. I am currently directly maintaining the AUR version of [penguins-eggs](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/penguins-eggs) and I'm participating in the [Manjaro Community Repository](https://gitlab.manjaro.org/packages/community/penguins-eggs).

The development versions of penguins eggs and other PKGBUILDs are instead in my [eggs-pkgbuilds](https://github.com/pieroproietti/eggs-pkgbuilds) repository.

### Arch
It's possible to install penguins-eggs from [AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/penguins-eggs) adding repo [Chaotic-AUR](https://aur.chaotic.cx/) and using `sudo pacman -Sy penguins-eggs`.

You can use a little utility I wrote: `addaura`. Use it in this way:

* `git clone https://github.com/pieroproietti/addaura`
* `cd addaura`
* `sudo ./addaura`

Addaura will add AUR repository and install penguins-eggs.

Of course you can also use yay: `yay penguins-eggs` or download the sources and run makepkg:

```
git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/penguins-eggs
cd penguins-eggs
makepkg -srcCi
```
### Manjaro
From penguins-eggs v9.4.3 the package is part of the [Manjaro community](https://gitlab.manjaro.org/packages/community/penguins-eggs) repo and can be installed with `pamac install penguins-eggs`.

Alternatively you can clone the package, and:
```
git clone https://gitlab.manjaro.org/packages/community/penguins-eggs/
cd penguins-eggs
makepkg -srcCi
```

# Usage

Once the package has been installed, you can have the new ```eggs``` command. Typing ```eggs``` will get the list of commands, typing ```eggs produce --help``` will get the eggs produce command help screen. You can also use the command autocomplete with the TABS key, you will get the possible choices for each command. In addition, there is a man page, so by typing ```man eggs``` you will get that help as well. You can also use the ```eggs mom``` command that interactively allows you to consult the help for all commands and online documentation.

## Examples

* Create a live system without user data:

```sudo eggs produce ```

* Create a live system with user data uncrypted.

```sudo eggs produce --clone```

* Create a live system with the encrypted user data.

```sudo eggs produce --cryptedclone```

At the moment eggs uses the default fast compression, which provides a faster compression speed, for the final compression it is worth using the ```--max``` flag to get more compressed ISOs.

In addition to the description of the commands in this README, you can consult the [Penguins' eggs official guide](https://penguins-eggs.net/docs/Tutorial/eggs-users-guide).

# Penguins' eggs official guide
The original edition of the eggs manual is released in Italian, of course other languages can be accessed using machine translation:

[Penguins' eggs official guide](https://penguins-eggs.net/docs/Tutorial/eggs-users-guide)

A nice thing to do to help users could be to make terminal samples, I did this some time ago, but they should be updated.

![terminal samples](https://github.com/pieroproietti/penguins-eggs/blob/master/documents/terminal-lessons/eggs_help.gif?raw=true)

# That's all Folks!
No need other configurations, penguins-eggs are battery included or better, as in the real, live is inside! :-D

# More informations
There is a [Penguins' eggs official guide](https://penguins-eggs.net/docs/Tutorial/eggs-users-guide) and same other documentation - mostly for developers - on the repository [penguins-eggs](https://github.com/pieroproietti/penguins-eggs) under [documents](https://github.com/pieroproietti/penguins-eggs/tree/master/documents). I want to point out [hens, differents species](https://github.com/pieroproietti/penguins-eggs/blob/master/documents/hens-different-species.md) a brief how to use eggs in Debian. Arch and Manjaro, and the post [Arch-naked](https://penguins-eggs.net/docs/Tutorial/archlinux-naked.html) on the blog which describes how to create an Arch naked live, install it, then dress the resulting system with a graphics development station.
